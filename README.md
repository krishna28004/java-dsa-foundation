# Java DSA Basics

This repository contains my Java practice code while learning
Java fundamentals and basic Data Structures & Algorithms.

The purpose of this repository is to build strong basics,
maintain consistency on GitHub, and track my learning progress.

## Topics Covered
- Java Basics (syntax, variables, input/output)
- Java Conditional Statements (If/else, Looping, switches, Java calculator, health buddy small project)
- java functions (factorial,Palindrome, Average of 3 num, print prime in range, binomial, decimal to binary)
- Java loops (prime or not, factorial,for loop, while loop, break, continue, sum of n, print table of any number)
- java Patterns (inverted star, alphabet pyramid, number pyramid, inverted star, floydTriangle, butterfly pattern)
- dsa arrays (binary search, kadans subarray, trapping water, buy sell stock, max subarrays)
- dsa sorting (bubble sort, selection sort, insertion sort, inbuilt sort )
  
## Structure
Each topic is organized into separate folders for better clarity
and readability.

## Goal
- Strengthen Java fundamentals
- Develop problem-solving skills
- Build a disciplined GitHub contribution habit
- Prepare for internships and future projects

More topics and improvements will be added regularly as I learn.
